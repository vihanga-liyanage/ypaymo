					  <h3>Offer Free Shipping </h3>
					  <p>Offering free shipping - usually just for domestic orders - is a sure-fire way to get your customer's attention, however, depending on your margins, it can also potentially cut into your profits.That said, the marketing punch that displaying 'Free Shipping' on your website provides can be a significant advantage over any competitors that don't offer the same perk. Deciding to offer free shipping will require you to either absorb the cost or slightly increase your prices to cover it.</p>

					  <h3>Charge What You Get Charged</h3>
					  <p>In some shopping carts (like Shopify) it's possible to setup real-time shipping quotes - in other words, your customers more or less pay exactly what you would pay to ship your products.There are always small discrepancies that can happen, of course, but in many cases you can end up breaking even between the shipping charges you collect and what you ultimately have to pay to ship the package.</p>

					  <h3>Offer Flat Rates</h3>
					  <p>Your third option is to offer a flat rate for every package, or flat rates for weight ranges and order totals.This particular method of charging for shipping requires a bit of preparation as you need to figure out your average cost of shipping a package. This is a best practice you should be doing anyway to make sure that you don't drastically undercharge or overcharge your customers.</p>

            		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
